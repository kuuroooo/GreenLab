**Research Question 1:** Does code optimization significantly impact energy consumption and related metrics compared to baseline?

**Generated:** October 16, 2025  
**Analysis:** OPTIMIZED variant vs BASELINE across 10 benchmarks

## üìä Key Findings

### Overall Result
**None of the metrics showed statistically significant deviation from zero at Œ± = 0.05**

However, the **median trends suggest**:
- ‚úÖ **Energy**: -3.94% (median reduction, not significant p=1.000)
- ‚úÖ **Power**: -3.89% (median reduction, not significant p=0.770)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CPU**: +2.90% (median increase, not significant p=0.193)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Memory**: +0.17% (median negligible, not significant p=0.193)
- ‚ùå **Time**: No data available (execution time = 0 in all measurements)

## üìà Statistical Test Results

All metrics tested using **Wilcoxon signed-rank test** (due to non-normal distributions as indicated by Shapiro-Wilk test p < 0.05).

| Metric | Median Œî% | Mean Œî% | SD | p-value | Significant? |
|--------|-----------|---------|-----|---------|--------------|
| **Energy %** | -3.94% | +36,034% | 110,981% | 1.000 | No (ns) |
| **Power %** | -3.89% | +215% | 574% | 0.770 | No (ns) |
| **CPU %** | +2.90% | +51% | 113% | 0.193 | No (ns) |
| **Memory %** | +0.17% | +0.42% | 0.79% | 0.193 | No (ns) |
| **Time %** | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

### Key Observations

1. **High Variability**: The massive difference between median and mean values (especially for Energy: median -3.94% vs mean +36,034%!) indicates **extreme outliers** in some benchmarks.

2. **Non-significance**: Despite median improvements, the high variability across benchmarks means we cannot confidently reject the null hypothesis that the optimization has no effect.

3. **Time Data Missing**: Execution time was not properly captured (all values = 0), preventing time-based analysis.

## üìä Visualizations

### Plot 1: Overall Distribution of Œî% Changes

**File:** `plots/rq1/plot1_delta_pct_distribution.png`

This multi-variable boxplot shows:
- Distribution of Œî% across all benchmarks for each metric
- Median line with 95% CI notches
- Individual benchmark data points
- Reference line at y = 0 (no change)
- Statistical significance annotations

**Interpretation:**
- Most boxplots span across y=0, indicating high variability
- Energy and Power medians are slightly below zero (small improvement trend)
- CPU and Memory medians are near zero (minimal change)
- Wide IQRs confirm heterogeneous effects across benchmarks

### Plot 2: Paired Per-Benchmark Energy Comparison

This slope chart shows:
- Each gray line connects Baseline ‚Üí Optimized for one benchmark
- Red bold line shows overall mean ¬± SE
- Median ŒîEnergy annotated on plot
- Log scale for Y-axis (energy in Joules)

**Interpretation:**
- Most lines slope downward ‚Üí energy reduction trend
- Two lines shoot upward dramatically (basic_string, sol1) ‚Üí major outliers
- Overall mean trend is slightly downward
- High variability visible

## üí° Interpretation & Discussion

### Why No Statistical Significance?

Despite seeing some benchmarks with large energy reductions (e.g., -96% for sequential_minimum_optimization), the statistical tests find no significant overall effect because:

1. **Extreme Outliers**: Two benchmarks (basic_string, sol1) show catastrophic energy increases (+351,796% and +8,668%), completely dominating the statistics.

2. **High Heterogeneity**: The optimization effect is highly **benchmark-dependent**:
   - Some benchmarks benefit greatly (‚àí96%)
   - Some are harmed greatly (+351,796%)
   - This variability prevents finding a consistent overall effect

3. **Small Sample Size**: Only 10 benchmarks means low statistical power to detect effects amid high variance.

### What Does This Mean?

**The "OPTIMIZED" variant is NOT universally beneficial:**
- ‚úÖ Works well for: sequential_minimum_optimization, convolution_neural_network, n_body_simulation
- ‚ùå Fails catastrophically for: basic_string, sol1
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed results for others

**This suggests the "OPTIMIZED" version may have bugs or inappropriate optimizations for certain code patterns.**

## üéØ Recommendations

### For the Thesis/Paper

1. **Report Non-Significance**: Be transparent that the OPTIMIZED variant does not show significant overall improvement.

2. **Investigate Outliers**: The basic_string and sol1 results need investigation:
   - Is there a bug in the OPTIMIZED implementations?
   - Are these legitimate worst-case scenarios?
   - Should these be excluded as implementation errors?

3. **Benchmark-Specific Analysis**: Instead of asking "Does optimization work?", ask "For which types of algorithms does optimization work?"

4. **Alternative Approach**: Compare individual **guidelines** (G1-G14) rather than the combined OPTIMIZED variant, as shown in the exploratory analysis where several guidelines showed consistent improvements.

### Statistical Recommendations

1. **Remove Outliers**: Consider re-running analysis excluding basic_string and sol1 if you can justify them as implementation errors.

2. **Non-Parametric Tests**: Already using Wilcoxon (good choice given non-normality).

3. **Effect Sizes**: Report median Œî% alongside p-values to show practical significance even when statistical significance is absent.

4. **Stratified Analysis**: Group benchmarks by type (string manipulation, ML algorithms, numerical simulation) and analyze separately.

## üìù Citation Template

For your paper/thesis:

> "We compared the OPTIMIZED variant against BASELINE across 10 benchmarks. Although median energy consumption showed a -3.94% reduction trend, this difference was not statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 1.000, n=10). The lack of significance was driven by extreme heterogeneity in optimization effects: while some benchmarks showed substantial reductions (e.g., sequential_minimum_optimization: -96.0%), others showed catastrophic increases (basic_string: +351,796%). This suggests that optimization effectiveness is highly benchmark-dependent and that the combined OPTIMIZED variant contains implementation issues requiring further investigation."

---

**Summary:** The OPTIMIZED variant does not show statistically significant improvement over BASELINE, primarily due to catastrophic failures on 2 benchmarks (basic_string, sol1) that overwhelm the positive effects seen on other benchmarks. Further investigation of these outliers is needed, and alternative analysis focusing on individual optimization guidelines may be more informative.
