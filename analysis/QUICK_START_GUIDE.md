## 🔍 Important Findings

### ✅ What Works Well

1. **G4, G9, G3, G7** guidelines show consistent energy savings
2. **No missing data** - all 930 measurements complete
3. **Clear patterns** - some guidelines work better for specific benchmarks

### ⚠️ Important Warnings

1. **G12 is problematic** - increases energy by 294.6% on average!
2. **OPTIMIZED variant needs investigation** - surprisingly high energy use
3. **High variability** - many combinations show CV > 20% (need interpretation)
4. **Benchmark-specific effects** - no single guideline works best everywhere

### 📊 Statistical Highlights

```
Overall Energy Consumption:
├── Median: 0.99 J (typical case)
├── Mean: 89.50 J (affected by outliers)
├── Range: 0.00 - 5,912.04 J (huge variation!)
└── IQR: 2.35 J (middle 50% spread)

Data Quality:
├── Outliers: 13.74% of data (125/910 measurements)
├── Missing data: 0% (perfect!)
└── Stability: Variable (CV ranges 91-554%)
```

## 📈 Next Steps

### For Your Research Paper

1. **Read** `DATA_EXPLORATION_SUMMARY.md` (comprehensive report)
2. **Review** the 15 plots in `plots/` directory
3. **Select** 3-4 key plots for your paper
4. **Use** summary tables for your results section
5. **Run** inferential statistics (ANOVA, effect sizes)

### Recommended Statistical Tests

```r
# Example: Test if variant differences are significant
# Using the cleaned_experiment_data.csv file

library(readr)
library(dplyr)

data <- read_csv("analysis/outputs/cleaned_experiment_data.csv")

# Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric, good for skewed data)
kruskal.test(energy_joules ~ variant, data = data)

# If significant, do post-hoc comparisons
library(FSA)
dunnTest(energy_joules ~ variant, data = data, method = "bonferroni")

# Calculate effect sizes
library(effsize)
baseline_data <- data %>% filter(variant == "BASELINE")
g4_data <- data %>% filter(variant == "G4")
cohen.d(g4_data$energy_joules, baseline_data$energy_joules)
```

### For Your Thesis

**Chapter Structure Suggestion:**

1. **Methods** → Describe the experiment setup (cite the data)
2. **Data Quality** → Use `data_quality_report.csv` + Plot 12
3. **Descriptive Stats** → Use `table2_summary_by_variant.csv`
4. **Main Results** → Use Plot 11 (heatmap) + `table10_guideline_effectiveness.csv`
5. **Benchmark-Specific** → Use Plot 5 (faceted) + `table4_best_worst_by_benchmark.csv`
6. **Discussion** → Interpret the benchmark×guideline interactions

## 🎨 Visualization Guide

### Most Important Plots (Pick 3-4)

**Plot 1: Faceted Boxplot** (`05_energy_boxplot_faceted.png`)
- Shows all benchmarks and variants
- Best for showing overall patterns
- Use as main results figure

**Plot 2: Heatmap % Change** (`11_energy_heatmap_pct_change.png`)
- Color-coded: green = good, red = bad
- Easy to spot patterns
- Use for showing guideline effectiveness

**Plot 3: Comparison by Type** (`15_energy_comparison_by_type.png`)
- Compares baseline vs optimized vs guidelines
- Clear visual comparison
- Use for discussion section

**Plot 4: Stability (CV)** (`12_stability_cv_by_variant.png`)
- Shows measurement reliability
- Important for methods section
- Supports data quality claims

## 💡 Pro Tips

### When Writing Your Results

✅ **DO:**
- Use **median** values (data is skewed)
- Report **IQR** for variability (robust to outliers)
- Mention **outliers** (13.98% of data)
- Show **effect sizes** not just p-values
- Acknowledge **benchmark-specific effects**

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use mean without mentioning median
- Ignore the high variability
- Forget to check outliers
- Make universal claims (varies by benchmark!)
- Report only statistical significance

### When Presenting Your Data

**Good Example:**
> "G4 guideline reduced median energy consumption by 8.8% compared to baseline (median: 0.94 J vs 1.03 J, IQR: 1.12 J). However, effectiveness varied by benchmark, with reductions ranging from -59% (convolution_neural_network) to +8% (ant_colony_optimization)."

**Bad Example:**
> "G4 was better than baseline (p < 0.05)."

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Why is mean so different from median?**  
A: Your data is highly skewed (skewness = 8.38). A few benchmarks use much more energy than others. Always report both!

**Q: Should I remove outliers?**  
A: No! These outliers might represent real behavior. Document them, but don't remove them unless you have a specific reason.

**Q: Which table should I put in my paper?**  
A: Start with `table10_guideline_effectiveness.csv` - it directly answers your RQ. Add `table4_best_worst_by_benchmark.csv` to show variability.

**Q: Are these differences statistically significant?**  
A: That's your next step! Run ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis tests using the cleaned data. The exploratory analysis suggests they are, but you need to confirm.

**Q: Why is OPTIMIZED performing so poorly?**  
A: That's a great finding to investigate! Check which specific benchmarks drive this result using the detailed tables.
